### This data set provides information about bike buyers
#### I have cleaned the data , created pivot charts and created dashboard and slicers.
##### Dashboard gives information about : 
      1.avg income of people who did or did not buy the bike?
      2.who buys the bikes the most, is it someone who lives far or near by?
      3.which age group people bought bikes the most?
  Note: Raw data is in sheet 1 and cleaned data in sheet 2(working sheet)
